# My Workflow ‚öôÔ∏è  
Over time, I‚Äôve developed a workflow that balances productivity, creativity, and adaptability. It‚Äôs a blend of tools, routines, and philosophies tailored to my unique needs, helping me manage everything from building my app to nurturing personal growth and lifelong habits.

## Guiding Principles üåü  
My workflow is shaped by a few key principles:  
- **Clarity**: Every tool and task should serve a purpose. I aim for simplicity and minimal friction in my workflow.  
- **Flexibility**: Life is unpredictable, so my system needs to adapt quickly to changes in priorities.  
- **Consistency**: Building habits and sticking to routines ensures steady progress over time.  
- **Integration**: Tools and processes must work seamlessly together, creating a cohesive system.  

These principles guide how I choose tools, structure my tasks, and approach my day-to-day work.

## Tools I Use üõ†Ô∏è  
I‚Äôve carefully selected tools that support my productivity and creativity across different areas of my life:  

### **1. Planning and Task Management**  
- **Todoist**: My go-to task manager for organizing projects into categories like Dashboard, Startup, Content Creation, and Personal Growth. It‚Äôs perfect for capturing tasks and planning ahead.  
- **iCloud Reminders**: A lightweight system for recurring tasks and reminders, like chores and physical fitness.  
- **Structured App**: For visualizing and scheduling my daily tasks in a timeline format.  

### **2. Knowledge Management**  
- **Obsidian**: My second brain, where I store notes, ideas, and connections. Its backlinking and graph visualization features help me see relationships between ideas.  
- **Doom Emacs**: For advanced note-taking and writing, especially with its org-md integration for Markdown recognition.  

### **3. Collaboration and Communication**  
- **Discord**: For connecting with communities and staying in touch with collaborators.  
- **GitHub**: For managing code and project versioning.  

### **4. Research and Content Consumption**  
- **Pocket**: A repository for saving and reading articles I find online.  
- **Spotify**: For podcasts and audiobooks that fuel my learning.  
- **Zotero**: A powerful tool for organizing research and academic references.  

### **5. Creative and Productivity Tools**  
- **Excalidraw**: For brainstorming, mind mapping, and visual planning.  
- **OBS**: For recording and sharing content, especially for video projects.  
- **LibreOffice**: For creating and editing documents.  

### **6. Development Tools**  
- **Windsurf + Visual Studio Code**: My primary IDE setup for coding.  
- **n8n**: For automating repetitive workflows and tasks.  

### **7. Daily Tools**  
- **Brave Browser**: My browser of choice for its speed, privacy features, and performance.  
- **Google Calendar**: For managing events and syncing schedules across devices.  
- **Google Drive**: For cloud storage and collaboration.

## How It All Fits Together üîÑ  
### **Daily Routine**  
1. **Morning Setup**:  
   - Open Structured to plan my day visually.  
   - Review Todoist for high-priority tasks and iCloud Reminders for recurring ones.  

2. **Focus Time**:  
   - Use Obsidian and Doom Emacs for writing and brainstorming.  
   - Switch to Windsurf for coding sessions.  

3. **Breaks**:  
   - Catch up on saved articles in Pocket or listen to a podcast on Spotify.  

4. **Evening Review**:  
   - Reflect on the day using Obsidian‚Äôs daily notes.  
   - Review tasks completed in Todoist and update tomorrow‚Äôs plan.

## My Workflow Philosophy  
I see my workflow as a **digital ecosystem**. Each tool has its role, and together, they create a harmonious system.  
- **Capturing Ideas**: Every thought, task, or inspiration goes into Obsidian, Todoist, or iCloud Reminders.  
- **Processing and Organizing**: Regularly, I review and organize captured items into actionable steps or notes.  
- **Executing**: Tools like Structured, Windsurf, and Excalidraw help me focus and get work done.  
- **Reflecting**: Using Obsidian‚Äôs daily notes and Zotero for research reviews keeps me grounded and focused on growth.

## Strengths of My Workflow ‚úÖ  
1. **Holistic Approach**: Covers everything from tasks and knowledge management to creative projects.  
2. **Scalability**: Adapts to new projects, priorities, or tools without requiring a complete overhaul.  
3. **Alignment with Goals**: Keeps me aligned with my long-term objectives, whether it‚Äôs building the Methexis App or nurturing personal habits.  

---

## Areas for Improvement üöß  
- **Automation**: While I use n8n for some workflows, there‚Äôs potential to automate more, like syncing Todoist and iCloud Reminders.  
- **Focus**: Sometimes, juggling too many tools can lead to distraction. Simplifying where possible is a constant effort.  
- **Front-End Integration**: As I build the Methexis App, integrating workflows for testing and design remains a work in progress.

## Final Thoughts  
My workflow is more than a productivity system; it‚Äôs a reflection of who I am and what I value. Every tool, habit, and process contributes to my journey of building, learning, and growing.  

If you‚Äôre looking to build your own workflow, my advice is to start simple, focus on what truly matters, and let your system evolve with you.  

Let‚Äôs keep growing! üå±
