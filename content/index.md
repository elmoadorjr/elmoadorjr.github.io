# Welcome to My Digital Garden 🌱
This is where I document my journey of building, learning, and growing. It's a collection of notes and ideas, spanning my interests in coding, philosophy, personal growth, and creativity. Everything here is a work in progress, just like me. 🚀

## What You’ll Find Here - 🌐 

**The Methexis App Journey**: 
Notes and reflections on my startup project—a niche social media platform focused on Worldview Graphs and meaningful debates. - 💡 

**Hobbies and Habits**: 
My thoughts on building lifelong habits and balancing my passions, from coding and philosophy to content creation and travel. - 

🛠️ **Technical Tidbits**: 
Explorations in tools and workflows, from React Native and Neo4j to Arch Linux and Doom Emacs. - 🌱 

**Personal Growth**:
Philosophical musings, reflections on egoism, and notes on improving myself. 

## Why a Digital Garden? 
I wanted a space that wasn’t constrained by perfection—a place where raw ideas, evolving thoughts, and even half-formed concepts could coexist. Unlike a blog, this garden grows over time, with connections forming between notes as they mature. 
## About Me 
I’m [[Elmo Ador Jr.]], a deep thinking creator and thinker passionate about crafting tools and experiences that spark deep conversations and personal growth. This digital garden mirrors my journey of learning to code, exploring ideas, and building something meaningful.
